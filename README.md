- Convert point cloud in PLY/LAS/LAZ/XYZ format to OSGB PagedLOD tree, so that the point cloud could be loaded into OpenSceneGraph instantly.
> This program could handle extremely large point cloud as PLY/LAS/LAZ/XYZ file is streaming to the convertor.
- Convert mesh in OBJ format to OSGB PagedLOD tree, so that the point cloud could be loaded into OpenSceneGraph instantly.
