# ToOSGB

Convert point cloud in PLY/LAS/LAZ/XYZ format to OSGB PagedLOD tree, so that the point cloud could be loaded into OpenSceneGraph instantly.

This program could handle extremely large point cloud as PLY/LAS/LAZ/XYZ file is streaming to the convertor.

### Thirdparty (source codes included for convenience):
- LASzip
- PlyIO
- TinyXML

> Recommend to use OpenSceneGraph 3.4.X, because the OSGB file generated by 3.6.X may NOT be correctly parsed by lower version of OpenSceneGraph
